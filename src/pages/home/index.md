        Heather helped me save my life! Her personal experience and
        intuitiveness recognized from the first day I met her that I was in an
        abusive relationship. She guided me through multiple calls, writings and
        in-person sessions to help me try to see this for myself. By sharing her
        story of finding her true self and how she moved forward, she helped me
        focus only on what I needed that day, encouraged me to relax my body and
        mind with yoga, exercises and loving people around me. Heather shared
        her stories, books and her heart. She also guided me to seek a therapist
        as an additional source of understanding and healing; and it was
        extremely helpful. We still check in from time to time for support and
        enhancing my new life. I can never thank Heather enough!

        Some people come into our lives for just a season, but make a huge
        impact. Heather’s Season in my life has been such a joy. I continue to
        learn and grow in body, mind and spirit through her yoga teachings and
        life principles.
