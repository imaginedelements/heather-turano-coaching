All valid questions and I have pondered the same things over my 35 years on this earth many many times.

## What is Anxiety?

Anxiety is a normal human response to fear and stress in our everyday lives. It is meant to protect us from danger. It is our fight or flight chemical response in the body. When we were cavemen (and woman) we needed this defense to run or fight off whatever animal or predator was about to harm us. Blood rushes from our organs to our limbs to be able to run faster and fight longer and we produce a hormone called Cortisol. In todays world we do the same thing. Your boss is yelling at you for something that went wrong and we start to get anexity, the chemical reaction is the same and we start to feel all tingly and be it a little edgy. Cortisol is the chemical that is produced when our body is under anxiety and stress which depletes our saritionion, the chemical in charge of making us feel happier. know that everyone on the planet gets anxiety, however we all treat it and handle the syptems of it differently.
