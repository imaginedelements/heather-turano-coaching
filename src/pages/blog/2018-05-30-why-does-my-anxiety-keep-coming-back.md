All valid questions and I have pondered the same things over my 36 years on this earth many many times. Lets answer some of those questions now.

## What is Anxiety?

Anxiety is a normal human response to fear and stress in our everyday lives. 

Anxiety is meant to protect us from danger. It is our fight or flight chemical response in the body. When we were cavemen (and woman) we needed this defense to run or fight off whatever animal or predator was about to harm us. 

## Why do I get it?

When we are triggered, blood rushes from our organs to our limbs (arms and legs) to be able to run faster and fight longer and we produce a hormone called Cortisol. 

In todays world a scenario may look more like this: Your boss is yelling at you for something that went wrong and you start to get anxiety. We start to feel all tingly and even a little edgy. This is that same fight or flight response happening. And we begin to produce cortisol.

Cortisol is the chemical that is produced when our body is under anxiety and stress which depletes our serotonin. Serotonin is the chemical in charge of making us feel happier. So naturally if we are always anxious we are depleting serotonin at rapid rates. When we are calm we start to balance back out and serotonin increase, so therefore we feel happier.

## How do I get rid of Anxiety?

Note to the "its only me" people... Everyone on the planet gets anxiety, however we all handle the symptoms of anxiety differently. 

We have the opportunity to decide to feed into those feelings or practice mindfulness in these moments to get out of it quicker. We decide the stories we make up in our head. Whether good or bad. 

So we can't get rid of it. It is part of us. we just need tools to out smart it and not feed into it.

## Helpful ways to work through anxiety and stress.

• Take some healing deep breaths into your belly and know it will pass. 

• Tell yourself stories that don't feed into your stress.

• Lie on the floor on your back, feel yourself grounded.

• Reach out to loved ones, a therapist, or coach and talk things through.* 

• Know you are not alone.
