  Every one has been there. You sleep like crap and you feel horrible when you
  open your eyes. And then instead of having compassion for yourself, you bet
  yourself up about feeling bad and not being your happiest or best self.

This is me. being Lazy AF and feeling sorry for myself as I wake up. 

I even slept in the guest room because i was tausing and turning and thought it would help to switch beds. well it didnt. And I got a few hours of sleep and had weird dreams about old managers and people crashing into my car in a Whole Foods parking lot. (these were actually my dreams.)

I finally decided it was time to open my eyes and start the day, but as i laid there I wondered "how would I get through the day if i had started it already feeling like crap."

So this is what I did:

1. **Acknowledged my feeling as real**

2. Listed the facts, why, how, what to do different.

3. I remembered that this is just one morning

4. Write about it (yep this blog post is like my journal entry, just a little more public)

5. I did some yoga
