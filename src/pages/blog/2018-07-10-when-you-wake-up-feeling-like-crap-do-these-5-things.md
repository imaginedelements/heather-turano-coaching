  Every one has been there. You sleep like crap and you feel horrible when you
  open your eyes. And then instead of having compassion for yourself, you bet
  yourself up about feeling bad and not being your happiest or best self.

This is me. being Lazy AF and feeling sorry for myself as I wake up. 

I even slept in the guest room because i was tausing and turning and thought it would help to switch beds. well it didnt. And I got a few hours of sleep and had weird dreams about old managers and people crashing into my car in a Whole Foods parking lot. (these were actually my dreams.)

I finally decided it was time to open my eyes and start the day, but as i laid there I wondered "how would I get through the day if i had started it already feeling like crap."

# So this is what I did:

## 1. Acknowledged my feeling as real

The thing is feels don't just come out of no where, feelings are in direct correlation with something you did. And they will tell you loud and clear if what you did either agreed with them or disagreed with them. 

"Hey feelings. I see you. You are real. How can I be of service to you today?"

That last line bringing me to point number two.

## 2. Listed the facts  (why and what to do different)

After telling your feel that "you see it". You have to break down the **WAY.** 

> Why do i think i feel like crap? Well, because i didnt sleep well.
>
> Why didn't I sleep well? Because you ate right before bed, I drank too much champagne, I didn't do my wind down routine, etc etc. 

You get the point. 

And then ask yourself "what can i do different next time".

> Tonight I will not eat after 9pm. I will not drink champagne and instead drink water to hydrate. I will keep my wind down schedule which means i will shut off all devices at 9. Watch a happy tv show or read some of my book. write a todo list for tomorrow and meditate for 10 minutes before I go to bed.

Done and DONE!





## I remembered that this is just one morning

1. Write about it (yep this blog post is like my journal entry, just a little more public)
2. I did some yoga
