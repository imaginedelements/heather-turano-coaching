  When our masculine and feminine energy is flowing through us equally we seem
  to have perfect harmony and balance in our lives. We can control what needs to
  be controlled while still staying open to change and the waves of life. We
  feel the most balance when these two sides are operating in a synchronized
  dance of back and forth. Like our breath; we need equal inhales and exhales to
  function. However, sometimes one energy out weighs the other. And different
  seasons invite leaning on one energy more than the other.

When our masculine and feminine energies are flowing through us equally, we seem to have perfect harmony and balance in our lives. We can control what needs to be controlled, while still staying open to change and the waves of life. 

We feel the most balance when these two sides are operating in a synchronized dance of back and forth. Like our breath; we need equal inhales and exhales to function. We need both masculine and feminane energy to stablize or Being.

However, sometimes one energy out weighs the other in different parts and times of our lives. 

Different seasons, also invite leaning on one energy more than the other. 

## Spring and Summer: Feminine Energy

Take spring for example; as we start to see new growth, we are asked to open our selves up to new things and let go of what "was". We shed the layers of winter and begin to wear lighter fabrics and expose parts of our body. We litterally "open our selves up".

When we are in more of our feminine energy. We are open, leaning back and allowing, flowing and flexible. We trust in life. The Structure and control of winter takes a back seat and the new growth of spring inspires us to "bloom" and "grow" new branches.

Summer is also an invitation to ditch that masculine energy. Rolling down the windows in our cars, allow the wind to flow through our hair, schools are closed and even our corporate offices are more relaxed (#summerfridays).

> Spring and summer are made for our energy to lean more toward the feminine. 

Relaxed, allowing, flowing. 



Fall and Winter: Masculine Energy

As Summer comes to a close, more structure starts to show its face during fall. Schools are back in session, we start to layer on cloths. Beginning to cover up, close off, settle in and find more stable ground. A pattern to our days begins again and the free flowing summer fades into the past.

Leaves shed from the trees leaving only the steady strong trunks, branches and roots visible. 

Autumn asks us to begin letting our masculine energy take the lead. Letting go of what doesn't serve us so we can become more focused on what does.  

In winter we eat heaver foods, we protect or hearts and heads with jackets and winter hats. The snow makes it difficult to drive so we are prompted to settle in and stay still.
