cow pose never looked so good! I struggle with plugged ducts along with many other breastfeeding difficulties. I have been at this game for 4 months now and decided to come to peace with the fact that I always need to be on high alert when it comes to my boobs.

Any hint of a tingle in my breasts that feels off is my cue to pull out my bag of "breastfeeding and pumping" tricks.

Unfortunately this bag of tricks finds me many times on the floor, detangling myself from the cords of my breast pump.

The positions that have saved me and I continue to do when i find myself with a plugged milk duct are as follows (but definitely not limited to...):

I have not taken photos of all these pose; as that would be slightly unflattering to me. however I will try to describe the poses as best I can and leave the visuals up to you.

Cow Pose:

seems like the name says it all... Cow pose on all fours is one of the main go to's when pumping out a plug for me.
