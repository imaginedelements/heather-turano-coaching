  Now I understand why they call it "cow pose". I am a pumping and nursing mom
  that deals with plugged milk ducks, engorgement, milk blebs; you name it and I
  have probably been through it. Many times finding myself on hands and knees
  while pumping trying to relieve my discomfort. Here are some of my go to basic
  yoga stretches that help "unplug my plugs" and open the chest for better flow.

  hunching we do as breastfeeding Moms.
