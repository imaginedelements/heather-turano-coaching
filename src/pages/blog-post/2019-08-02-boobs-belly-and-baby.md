As I sit here and pump, It seems like a perfect time to multi task and write a little about the first weeks of being a new mom. 

## 1. If you decide to feed your baby with your boob, read this.

Lets discuss being tied to a chair by either nursing, bottle feedings, or pumping. This in its self is totally new territory for me. And I have to say a little claustrophobic and constraining. Some woman may find this amazing. They may feel like feeding their child every two hours for 45 minutes is "beautiful" and "nurturing to their soul". However, as much as I enjoy the fact that I, single handedly, can provide all my child needs to survive. I also find it exhausting and limiting to my usually active, “get up and go” lifestyle. 

So after approximately 1 week of sitting exclusively in my brown recliner, I was ready to figure out a balance to it all. You know, before I had a meltdown.

After my 3rd week of feeding and pumping I found myself in a little predicament. Breast engorgement, plugged milk ducts and milk blisters! No one ever seems to tell you how freaking gnarly breastfeeding can be. So that is what I am doing right now. BREASTFEEDING IS HARD, TIME CONSUMING AND YOU NEED SUPPORT!

God bless Lactation Consultants. That is all I can say. I booked an appointment with [Katie Madden](https://balancedbreastfeeding.com/katie-madden/). Katie has been the Director of [Balanced Breastfeeding](https://balancedbreastfeeding.com/) at The Birth Center in Wilmington, DE since 2009. Her approach was refreshing. No matter if you breastfeed, only pump or formula feed; there is no judgement. Because, no two people are the same. Some woman over produce (#me), some woman can't produce enough and some woman just down right "don't want to breastfeed at all" (which I totally understand!!!). It's all about finding your own "BALANCE". 

I left the lactation appointment with a game plan and small goals. 7 weeks later, I still get clogs, blisters and engorgement. However I know how to nip it in the bud before it gets worse.
