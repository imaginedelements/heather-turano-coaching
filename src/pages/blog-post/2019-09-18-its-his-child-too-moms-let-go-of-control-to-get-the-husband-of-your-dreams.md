• Does your husband not help out with caring for your child? 

• Do you wish he would step up and support you more? 

• Does he not understand how hard motherhood is?

**Well ladies, I have some news for you. It could be your fault. And here is why!**

## 1. Let Go Of Control

Its Ok, I know it is extremely hard, But, all we have to do is, let go, breathe, and realize our baby wont die in the hands of their Fathers.

## 2. Realize Your Husband is Not You, and That is an Asset.

I know "us ladies" have the power to do EVERYTHING soooooo perfect (insert "roll eye" emoji here). But our strive for perfection when it comes to parenting is the main reason our Men aren't showing up to Fatherhood. 

> NEWS FLASH: If you didn't already know, your husband isn't you! He doesn't have magical boobs, nor does he have that beautiful feminine motherly intuition.

Allow him to make mistake and figure it out on his own. The benefit to allowing him to lead, is that inevitably he will see how hard this whole Motherhood thing really is. He will then in-turn appreciate you more and show up to support you when you need help.

## 2. Stop Tearing Your Husband Down and Build Them Up Instead

Have you heard of **positive reenforcement** for your children? Well, it applies here as well. 

Focusing on what your partner or husband does wrong only does the opposite of what you want. It makes him not take the lead, self conscious of his decisions and walk on egg shells around you and your child.

**Does this sound familar?**

> "you can't do anything right"
>
> "you always makes things harder"
>
> "I can do it better myself"

Try to encourage him, educate him why you do things, tell him how much he helps you.

## It Chemically Makes Your Man Happier to Help

Most men really want to do right by the woman in there life and provide for their family. When a man can provide and support his family he releases **serotonin _(the happy making hormone)_** and his **cortisol** levels go down **_(cortisol is the chemical your body releases that causes anxiety and stress)_**. 

> When his cortisol is low, and serotonin is high, it makes for a GREAT Husband Chemical Cocktail! 

When a man can make a woman happy (or anyone happy for that matter) he is most definitely going to be an overall happier person. And less stressed equals a better father and husband. **Its actually that simple.**

## Say thank you!

Acknowledge and Verbalize the GOOD he does and all the ways he helps you. 

You want him to do more for you? Stop only telling him the bad and start praising him for the good.



I know, I know, there are definitely some men out there that really are horrible fathers and partners. Believe me I have had my fair share of those men. 

Thank goodness for those super amazing Men that know how to show up for us and their children. We moms need to keep empowering them! I see too many woman saying "their husbands/partners cant do it" and "dont know how". The men in your life are completely capable of taking care of "THEIR CHILD". So woman, Please step back, relax, and let them!!!!
