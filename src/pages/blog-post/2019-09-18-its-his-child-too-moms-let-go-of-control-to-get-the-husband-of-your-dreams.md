Does your husband not help out with caring for your child? 

Do you wish he would step up and support you more? 

Does he not understand how hard motherhood is?



Well Ladies I have some news for you. It could be your fault. Sorry, not sorry.



## Stop getting mad at him for not being you

I know us ladies have the power to do everything soooooo perfect (insert "roll eye" emoji here). But our strive for perfection when it comes to parenting is the main reason our Men aren't showing up to Fatherhood. 

NEWS FLASH, if you didnt already know, your husband isn't you! And he doesn't have magical boobs, nor does he have that beautiful feminine motherly intuition.

But, thats ok. All we have to do is, let go, breathe, and realize our baby wont die.



Because the bottom line is; "he cant do anything right", "he always makes things harder", and "I can do it better myself". Am I right? Is that the vocabulary that goes on in your mind Mommas, or is it just me? 

I know, I know, there are definitely some men out there that really are horrible fathers and partners. Believe me I have had my fair share of those men. 

However, most men really want to do right by the woman in there life and provide for their family. It is actually in their chemical make up. When a man can provide and support his family he releases serotonin (the happy making hormone) and his cortisol levels go down (cortisol is the chemical your body releases that causes anxiety and stress).

So when a man can make a woman happy (or anyone happy for that matter) he is most definitely going to be an overall happier person. And less stressed equals a better father and husband. Its actually that simple.



Say thank you!

Acknowledge and Verbalize the GOOD he does and all the ways he helps you. 

You want him to do more for you? Stop only telling him that bad and start praising him for the good.



Thank goodness for those super amazing Men that know how to show up for us and their children. We moms need to keep empowering them! I see too many woman saying "their husbands/partners cant do it" and "dont know how". The men in your life are completely capable of taking care of "THEIR CHILD". So woman, Please step back, relax, and let them!!!!
