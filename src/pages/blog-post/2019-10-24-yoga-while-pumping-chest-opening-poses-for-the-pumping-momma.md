  Now I understand why they call it "cow pose". I am a pumping and nursing mom
  that many times has found myself on hands and knees while pumping. I suffer
  from plugged milk ducks and found that some very basic yoga poses help "unplug
  my plugs". Here are a few easy stretches I have found help open the chest for
  better flow. These Poses also help the neck shoulders and back open up after
  hunching over the pump or our little ones.
