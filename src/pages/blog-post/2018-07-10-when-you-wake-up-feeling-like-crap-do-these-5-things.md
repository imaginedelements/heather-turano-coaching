  Every one has been there. You sleep like crap and you feel horrible when you
  open your eyes. And then instead of having compassion for yourself, you bet
  yourself up about feeling bad and not being your happiest or best self.

This is me. being Lazy AF and feeling sorry for myself as I wake up.

I even slept in the guest room because i was tausing and turning and thought it would help to switch beds. well it didnt. And I got a few hours of sleep and had weird dreams about old managers and people crashing into my car in a Whole Foods parking lot. (these were actually my dreams.)

![This is me. being Lazy AF and feeling sorry for myself as I wake up. ](/img/img_0105.jpg)

I finally decided it was time to open my eyes and start the day, but as i laid there I wondered "how would I get through the day if i had started it already feeling like crap."

# So this is what to do if you feel like CRAP:

## 1. Acknowledge your feeling is real

The thing is feels don't just come out of no where, feelings are in direct correlation with something you did. And they will tell you loud and clear if what you did either agreed with them or disagreed with them.

"Hey feelings. I see you. You are real. How can I be of service to you today?"

That last line bringing me to point number two.

## 2. List the facts (why and what to do different)

After telling your feel that "you see it". You have to break down the **WAY.**

> Why do I think I feel like crap? Well, because I didn't sleep well.
>
> Why didn't I sleep well? Because you ate right before bed, I drank too much champagne, I didn't do my wind down routine, etc etc.

You get the point.

And then ask yourself "what can i do different next time".

> Tonight I will not eat after 9pm. I will not drink champagne and instead drink water to hydrate. I will keep my wind down schedule which means i will shut off all devices at 9. Watch a happy tv show or read some of my book. write a todo list for tomorrow and meditate for 10 minutes before I go to bed.

Done and DONE!

## 3. Remember that this is just one morning

Dont be a drama queen like me and say "why do I feel like crap all the time". Because we all know that is simply not true. Get real. This is just one morning out of 365 mornings you will have. I am almost positive that every morning before and after this one has or will be good.

This one is just a blip and the faster you readjust what isn't working the faster you get back to having more GREAT mornings and less crappy ones. #truth

## 4. Write about it

Lucky for me I have a blog where I can write stuff like this. However, that wasn't always the case. So I would suggest getting a journal. Get it out on paper. Write down how you feel, give yourself permission to feel it. Then make a plan on how to get through it and help yourself.

If writing isn't your thing maybe you call a close friend, a coach or a mentor and talk it out.

Whatever it is it needs to be worked through. And when you work through things they hold less power over your moods and feelings

## 5. Do some yoga

When I say yoga I mean anything that will raise your heart rate. Maybe you do 10 sun salutations or maybe you do 10 jumping jakes. maybe you go even farther and get outside and go for a jog.

When you exercise, your body releases chemicals called endorphins. Endorphins interact with the receptors in your brain that reduce your perception of pain. Hence, the "feeling better" part.

# What else do you do to have better mornings?
