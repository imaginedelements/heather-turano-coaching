## Try This Meditation to Invite In More Masculine Energy and Grounding this Fall.

![BHU MUDRA](/img/bhu-mudra1.jpg "BHU MUDRA")

1. **Sit in a comfortable seat** with your sit bones rooted on the ground and a long spine. 

2. **Hand and arms come to BHU MUDRA.** Root your ‘peace’ fingers (pointer and middle fingers) into the ground with your arms straight out to the sides as you sit on the floor (or press peace fingers into the centers of your thighs).  

3. **Notice your natural breath,** perhaps sensing it dropping down into your belly and pelvis to assist in rooting and grounding you. 

4. **Hold your breath for 5-10 natural breaths** to start, increasing over time if you like.  

5. **State this affirmation three times out loud,** then silently as you breathe. **_“My Roots run deep, I am supported by the earth"._** 

## This Mudra and Meditation connects you with your physical body to the Earth.

Instills feeling secure, safe and grounded.

Can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and frenetic energy.
