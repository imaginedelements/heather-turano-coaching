  Have you ever wondered if a man likes you? Have you ever dated a guy and you
  get mixed signals? Well I am here to clear all the confusion up with this
  simple mantra you can repeat to yourself. "How a man treats me is how he feels
  about me".

Bottom line ladies, **how a man treats you is how he feels about you**. lets repeat that together, How a man treats you is how he feels about you. Now one more time and direct it toward yourself. **How a man treats ME is how he feels about ME. **

**Lets start with a story shall we?**

You are dating a man for about 3 months. And he is TELLING you that he is "crazy about you" (something every woman has been waiting to hear her life, am I right?). However, he is just so busy that he can't talk on the phone and he can only go out Wednesday nights because he has so much going on.

So what do we as woman do with that information? We start to convince ourselves that this is enough for us and it is ok. Our internal dialogue to ourselves may sound something like this,

> "He told me he is crazy about me, so that means he is crazy about me. He is just super busy at work because he is trying to get promoted and has very little free time to see anyone right now. And he can only text me because he hates talking on the phone with people. And we can only go out Wednesday night, because that is the only time he is available because he sees his family and friends on the weekends. And that is totally enough for me because he is a great guy, and it is so hard to find great guys these days. So I should hold onto this one because he may be the only great guy left in the whole world! And what if I let him go and then I am alone forever and regret not sticking it out with this guy."

Yep that is what we do! We start to convince ourselves that this is ok because he SAYS he is crazy about us. Even though his **ACTIONS** don't match his **WORDS**.

**Words mean nothing with out reenforcing those words with action.**

Men use **words** to tell woman what they know woman want to hear, because it is easier than telling the truth and possibly having a disagreement. Men will do anything to avoid upsetting a woman, even lie.

It is only with constant actions or **“investment over time” **that you can gauge how a man truly feels about you. When he invests his resources like **time, money** and **energy **into you, that is the clear sign he really likes you.

**So to recap: How he is treating you is how he feels about you. **

So stop convincing yourself that he is treating you better than he is. Take men at face value. Lean back and and just watch him, he will show you how he feels about you. Good or bad.
