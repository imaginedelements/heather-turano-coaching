  Just like eating; sleep is essential to a child's development. Not to mention
  a parents sanity. Respecting a babies need to sleep is super important. What
  are the cues? they just woke up how can they be tired after an hour? I want to
  hold them and cuddle, they need me to sleep.

Nova is 3 months old on Saturday! How time flies!



Your Three month old should sleep a total of 5 hours during the day. With awake times of 1.5 to 2 hours.  Babies should not be up longer than 2 hours or they start to become over tired.
