  As a yoga instructor I hear this all too much. So many students can bend,
  balance and twist, but struggle to relax and sit with themselves.The art of
  relaxation is harder than it looks. And the whole point of moving, bending and
  then finally finding the pose of savasana isn’t for a work out. It is to get
  you set up for a deeper form of relaxation called “meditation”.

**I have been happily easing back into my yoga practice and workout routine since recovering from childbirth #nottoofun.** I have to admit my body is not bouncing back as quickly as I would have hoped. I guess being 37 and never needing to be too concerned about about my weight in the past has bit me in the butt a little. Oh well, their are worse things. That being said, I have finally nailed down a "back to work" schedule and care for Nova this past week. Mainly so I can schedule coaching clients and have sold blocks of time for writing. However it is also nice to be able to make a few of my favorite yoga classes while she is gone! 

I like to go to a yoga class called _Mind Body Balance_ at my local gym. I love the instructor on Tuesdays and Thursdays and try to make it each week. This past week, as I set up my mat, there was an extremely fit woman behind me. 

> I know you know who I am talking about; mid 40's, tan, worked out everyday of her life, doing the same exact workout routine since she was in high school, probably weighs the same amount as in high school too.

Any-who, as she was uncomfortably seated on her mat, I overheard her telling the woman next to her that this was the second yoga class she has ever taken in her life. Her doctor recommended yoga a few times per week to reduce stress because she is super "type A". Her words, not mine.

As we move through class the yoga instructor inside me couldn't help but watch her and evaluate her _down dogs_ and _forward folds_ (It is a sickness and a struggle now not to jump in and want to help with peoples alignment all the time. I am working on it.). After the class was over and we bowed and "ommmmm"ed, she turns to the woman next to her once again and says “that was a really nice class, but I could do with out the end when we were just laying down doing nothing”. Haha, "Savasana", I thought to myself. She continued by saying that all she was thinking about was everything that needed to get done that day. She said she was bored of just sitting there and she could have been doing so much stuff in that time she was just lying there.

**Side Note: the savanna was approximately 3 minutes long...**

# I promise, Savasana isn't just a waste of time.

As a yoga instructor I hear this all too much. So many students can bend, balance and twist, but struggle to relax and sit with themselves.

The art of relaxation is harder than it looks. And the whole point of moving, bending and then finally finding the pose of savasana isn’t for a work out. It is to get you set up for a deeper form of relaxation called “meditation”.

I always tell students “the hardest pose is usually the pose you need to practice the most”. Savasana is no different!

If you are a person that finds savasana annoying, stressful or difficult. Maybe consider practicing it more. 

Learning to **_relax with attention and_** remaining conscious and alert while still being at ease. is no easy task. Try not to fall a sleep or thinking about the millions of things on your todo list while you are lying there. This pose has the amazing ability to help you become more aware of yourself. You can then begin to notice and let go of long-held tension in your body and mind!
