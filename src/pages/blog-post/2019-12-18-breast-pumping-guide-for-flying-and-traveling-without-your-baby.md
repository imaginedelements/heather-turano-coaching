  my baby girl. In this post you will find my full experience with Pumping,
  Freezing, Packing, and Flying with breast milk. I will explain my pumping set
  up and schedule along with tips on packing and flying with over 100 oz of
  breast milk. Along with my encounter with TSA and airport experience.

**Recently I traveled to Palm Springs, CA for 6 days!** I am sure you are saying **"whats the big deal about that?".** This use to be a "no big deal" type of trip, back before I was a Mom. But now I have a 6 month old and I am still nursing and breastfeeding! Making traveling and deciding to travel **WITHOUT my baby** a little more difficult. 

You see, If I wanted to continue to breastfeed/nurse my child and also travel; I had to figure out a way to do both. So this meant using all the new pumping technology and resources I had around me to MAKE IT HAPPEN!

Here is a guide to my individual experience. What worked for me, and my thoughts/feelings around traveling, flying, pumping, and packing/freezing breastmilk. 

**I hope this post helps Moms take the leap to travel while breastfeeding WITH OUT BABY.**  I hope this also helps start to **NORMALIZE pumping in public**. _(No, I dont mean sitting in your car or a lactation room or bathroom stall; covering and hiding away to pump for 20 to 30 minutes, 6 to 7 times per day.)_ **I mean pumping while walking around, at restaurants, playing golf, hiking, etc. A huge part of breastfeeding is pumping. And normalizing pumping in public is just as important as normalizing nursing in public.**

## Get a Lactation Consultant

Speak with a professional about your desire to travel while breastfeeding and come up with a plan together. 

I was fortunate to have the worlds best lactation consultant Katie Madden by my side through this journey. Katie owns Balanced Breastfeeding and understands the importance of each individuals different needs and desires. 

We discussed a number of things before making my decision to travel. Some questions you may want to ask your Consultant:

1. How many times should you pump each day to keep your supply up? 
2. When is the beast times to pump for your individual body and supply level? 
3. What are the TSA and Airline policies for breastmilk, coolers, pumping devices, etc.?

## Pumping in Public

I reached a 4 month goal and decided to treat myself to the [closed system Freemie Cups](https://freemie.com/collections/freemie-cups-for-your-pump/products/freemie-closed-system-collection-cup-set) and a [Bellababy pocket portable breast pump](https://www.amazon.com/Bellababy-Electric-Hanging-Adpaters-Changers/dp/B07TD4P8DS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3MSLBYBYJDV9M&keywords=bellababy+pump&qid=1577721990&sprefix=bellababy%2Caps%2C131&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExMlZINUQ5MDVLNFIwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTE2OTQzRDdLVjJNRzFIOE5CJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTI4NDZQUU4wVzVGQjc3NjImd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl). this set up cost me around $145. which is way less than the $500 Willow Portable pump and it got me up and moving while pumping! Which was my ultimate goal.

**My philosophy with pumping has always been the same as Nursing. I WILL DO IT ANYWHERE.** #normalizepumping

Having this mindset when I started my trip helped tremendously! **I was able to pump while walking around the airport, on the planes, checking into our villa, In the car, in restaurants, by the pool, playing golf, drinking coffee on the porch, on hikes in Joshua Tree national park. You name it, and I probably pumped there!** And why the hell not! I had limited time away and hell if I was going to sit in a room, by myself, pumping for 30 minutes 6 to 7 times per day! That's over 3.5 hours per day wasted pumping. **UMMMM NOPE!**

This set up worked perfect. and if you want to feel free and pump. I recommend you splurge! buy the portable pump NOW. Do not wait. You will not regret it!



## Airport Lactation Rooms

Ok so I spotted a few of these "lactation rooms" in the air ports. My thoughts on these rooms are as follows...

WTF. One lactation room was in Philadelphia International Airport and it looked like a porta-potty. I looked inside to find an uncomfortable metal bench to sit on with no light coming in. Is nursing or pumping really the same as shitting on a toilet? No thanks. I think I will just sit in an open area or walk around while pumping. Maybe I will even grab something to eat at one of the restaurants and pump there. 

> Thanks for the option to close myself in a metal box for 30 minutes Philly (insert roll-eye emoji here). super generous of you.

Another lactation room was in Palm Springs, CA Airport. If you have never been to this airport, you should go. It is a beautiful outdoor, open-air airport with gardens and benches. There is even a playground and grass to walk your dog on! I am sure you are thinking "well, they definitely have a beautiful lactation area for nursing or pumping mothers.". Um nope! Right next to the woman's bathroom was a lactation room. I walked from the beautiful sunny 70 degree wether into the tile lactation room that resembled the bathrooms next door. It was cold dark and uncomfortable. It had one tile bench built in to the side of one of the walls and that was it! Why would I decided to pump in a cold dark room, when I could sit on a bench in the sun looking at the beautiful flowers and breathing the fresh air? Are the people that create these rooms mad? 

> I will scream it from the rooftop again! "Breastfeeding, nursing, and pumping is not like using the bathroom people!!!!"

My conclusion on the airport "lactation rooms that they so kindly have put in place for woman to use. "Um thanks, but actually no thanks! I will pump and or nurse where ever I want. If some one is uncomfortable wit that. Than I suggest they go sit in the damn lactation rooms.".
