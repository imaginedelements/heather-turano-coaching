Recently I traveled to Palm Springs, CA for 6 days. I am sure you are saying "whats the big deal about that?". This use to be a "no big deal" type of trip, back before I was a Mom. But now I have a 6 month old and I am still breastfeeding! Making traveling and deciding to travel with out my baby a little more difficult. 

You see, If I want to continue to breastfeed my child and also travel; I in turn had to figure out a way to do both. So this meant using all the new pumping technology and resources I have around me to MAKE IT HAPPEN!

Here is a guide to my individual experience. What worked for me and my thoughts and feelings behind traveling, flying, pumping, and packing breastmilk. 

I hope this post helps Moms take the leap to travel while breastfeeding.  I hope this also helps start to normalize pumping in public. (No, I dont mean sitting in your car or a lactation room or bathroom stall; covering and hiding away to pump for 20 to 30 minutes, 6 to 7 times per day.) I mean pumping while walking around, at restaurants, playing golf, hiking, etc. A huge part of breastfeeding is pumping. And normalizing pumping in public is just as important as normalizing breastfeeding in public.



Lactation Consultant: 

Speak with a professional about your desire to travel while breastfeeding and come up with a plan together. 

I was fortunate to have the worlds best lactation consultant Katie Madden by my side through this journey. Katie owns Balanced Breastfeeding and understands the importance of each individuals different needs and desires. 

We discussed a number of things before making my decision to travel. Some questions you may want to ask your Consultant:

1. How many times should you pump each day to keep your supply up? 
2. When is the beast times to pump for your individual body and supply level? 
3. What are the TSA and Airline policies for breastmilk, coolers, pumping devices, etc.?
