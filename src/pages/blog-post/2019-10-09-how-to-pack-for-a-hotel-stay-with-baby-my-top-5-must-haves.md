Baby Diaper Caddy Organizer

This [Diaper Caddy](https://www.amazon.com/Putska-Baby-Diaper-Caddy-Organizer/dp/B077TT5RC7/ref=sr_1_2?crid=20BUR5IU4N4B9&keywords=baby+tote+organizer&qid=1570655406&sprefix=baby+tote%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-2) has been a life saver on road trips with Nova. I am able to pack diapers, wipes, [burp cloths](https://www.amazon.com/Muslin-Cloths-Cotton-Washcloths-Absorbent/dp/B07NSVTFS3/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2C605FK4ISJSQ&keywords=burp+cloths+muslin&qid=1570656063&sprefix=burp+cloths%2Caps%2C145&sr=8-4), [swaddle blankets](https://www.copperpearl.com/collections/swaddle-blankets), [diaper rash cream](https://www.amazon.com/Boudreauxs-Butt-Paste-Ointment-Preservative/dp/B00569GU18/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=diaper+cream&qid=1570656181&sr=8-10), hand sanitizer, etc. in one handy organized place. 

Just place it on a counter near where you will be changing the baby and you have an instant changing station in seconds!
