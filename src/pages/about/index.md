    **The whole “talking about yourself” is sort of a strange, awkward thing,
    have you ever noticed that?** What are you supposed to say about yourself?
    And for that matter, how does a person even approach this?


    * **Where were you born?** I was Born in Florida.

    * **What is your sign?** Typical Gemini.

    * **What is your background?** I am an Italian American (Yes, I grew up
    saying words incorrectly)

    * **What is your favorite food?** I love cheese; Damn you lactose!


    Maybe you go with an elevator pitch? Greatest accomplishments? **Hummmmm,
    nope, thats not it. Let me think…**

sectionOne:

    **I am pretty much just like you.** I am a curious, driven, “don’t fit into
    a mold” type of person. I have most DEFINITELY been where you are right now.
    And ABSOLUTELY struggled through the same quicksand you find yourself
    dredging through at the moment. 


    I am a writer, a coach and a speaker for those who don’t have a big enough
    Italian voice. My life, like yours, is dedicated to learning how to get out
    of my own way and become the most FREAKING extraordinary human I can be.
  title: ... Ok I got it! Let’s just get honest.
sectionTwo:

    This section is my “been there done that" story. Sort of the whole reason
    why I am now dedicated to **helping smart, thoughtful, multi-dimensional**
    humans like yourself.  


    I know first hand about toxic relationship cycles, the codependent doubt
    that “you aren’t lovable”, the “not enoughness” voice that keeps nagging you
    until you fall asleep. The burning desire to be more than just your job,
    paycheck, kids and pretend happy persona we create on social media. Because
    all any of us are really craving is just some **_honest, gosh-darn
    connection_** and some **_kickass passion_** in our life. **"Gimme that JOY
    and HAPPINESS damn it!".**


    Lastly, My life and energy is to support your growth and strip away the
    stories you have told yourself of who you **THINK you are**, so that you can
    become the crazy awesome people you are **MEANT to be**!
